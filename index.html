Review1 'Just wow!
         We stayed in the Daft Punk room it was amazing spacious room, comfortable bed and so daft punk
         The restaurant and bar was superb the food was spectacular and those cocktails so creative i wanted to try them all!'

Review2 'Can't wait till our next trip here.
         The busted concert was awesome!
         being able to just walk to our room after the concert was so good and the rooms are amazing value but so luxurious.
         best bit the morning after we enjoyed the day in the hotel spa and what can i say just yes dont forget the spa just swesome!'

         food was spectacular and the cocktails oh the cocktails so so good.
         Already planning our next trip so many upcoming bands our new gig destination'

Review4 'We came to watch Billie Eilish, what an amazing vibe tonight!
         the venue wasnt overcrowded just the right amount for a sold out gig could actually enjoy the music without getting rammed all the time.
         definitely appreciated the air controlled venue too dont think I've ever been to a gig and not come out sweaty.
         5 stars all the way definitely booking my future gigs here'
