Feel free to clone this project and see how I set it all up, this was my very first front-end project on my path into tech.\
To achieve this I took part in the 
ü©∑**Code First Girls**ü©∑ Web Development kickstarter course, its free to sign up for and the mountain of experience I gained it was well worth the wait for a space on this amazing free course!

My Expo Lounge project recieved ü©∑**Best in Class**ü©∑ an achievement I am very proud of especially as this is my very first exposure to tech.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and am happy with what I have achieved as a first time introduction into tech and into Web development.

I hope in the future to combine this project with future projects to showcase my skills across multiple coding languages and broaden my knowledge further to use the work I have put into this
for larger project once my tech experience has developed further.
