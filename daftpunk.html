        Daft Punk were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo.
        They achieved early popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, combining elements of house music with funk, disco, techno, rock and synth-pop.
        The duo garnered further acclaim and commercial success and are now regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music history.
        Top hits include Get Lucky, One More Time and Instant Crush.
