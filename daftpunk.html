          Designed by Daft Punk ‘French house meets robots’ Daft Punk were a
          French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas
          Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They achieved early
          popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement,
          combining elements of house music with funk, disco, techno, rock and
          synth-pop. The duo garnered further acclaim and commercial success and
          are now regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music
          history. Top hits include Get Lucky, One More Time and Instant Crush.
