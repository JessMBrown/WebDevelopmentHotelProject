          Designed by Tenacious D 'All hard rock with plenty of comedy'
          Tenacious D is an American comedy rock duo formed in Los Angeles,
          California, in 1994. It was founded by actors Jack Black and Kyle
          Gass, who were members of The Actors' Gang theater company at the
          time. The duo's name is derived from "tenacious defense", a phrase
          used by NBA basketball sportscasters Walt Frazier and Marv Albert. As
          a sort of a partial member, Dave Grohl has also recorded drums and
          percussion on all studio works, but does not perform live. Top hits
          include Tribute,Wicked game and The Metal
