    <p>Designed by Tenacious D 'All hard rock with plenty of comedy'
        Tenacious D is an American comedy rock duo formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1994. It was founded by actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass, who were members of The Actors' Gang theater company at the time. The duo's name is derived from "tenacious defense", a phrase used by NBA basketball sportscasters Walt Frazier and Marv Albert.
        As a sort of a partial member, Dave Grohl has also recorded drums and percussion on all studio works, but does not perform live.
